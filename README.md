# PyMisc
Miscellaneous code snippets and scripts in python, usually for functionality or performance testing.

## Compatability
All code was written for Linux, compatability with other operating systems is not guaranteed.

## Installing requirements
Requirements will not be updated regularly and only reflect the most recent package version at the time of writing any piece of code that requires those packages. Normally, the most recent versions of each package can be used. URLs to spacy models can however not be made dynamic to always download the latest model. To install requirements, use:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`
